I am an ambitious and responsible person eager to cooperate. I have extensive experience in IT and have a passion for electronic devices in general. In general, I have a passion for details and aesthetics, composition and professionalism. I have no experience with controlling drone devices, but I have the desire to learn. I am looking for a job that will be interesting for me and where I can improve my knowledge and provide you and your business with quality service. I don't have a drone license. I have extensive experience in programs such as Photoshop, Sony Vegas Pro, AutoCad, Blender, Cinema4D, SolidWorks, 3DMax, Aspire, MachLoader. In my spare time I learn C++, HTML, PHP, CSS. By creating web pages. At the same time, I was involved in the restoration of oldtimer cars and the production of 17-meter sailboats. I want to say that I am actually most interested in the process of how things work and what parts they are made of. I am involved in the creation of blueprints, views, sections, perspectives, 3D modeling, conceptual representations, etc. Briefly about me. I don't want to brag, I just want to give an impression of what I like and what interests me. It would really mean an invitation to an interview and an opportunity to work. 

All the best, 
Lovre.
